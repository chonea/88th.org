<h2>Section 2. Unit Requirements</h2>

<p>There are certain prerequisites that must be met in order to be a member of the 88th Mechanized Militia.</p>

<ol>
	<li><h3>Activity</h3><p>Each member is expected to maintain a certain level of activity during their tour with the Militia. Unless extenuating circumstances prevent your involvement and you have notified your commander of those circumstances, a reasonable minimum of two (2) evenings per week are expected. This includes meetings, training, game play, and/or tournaments.</p></li>
	<li><h3>MechWarrior® Online™ (MWO)</h3><p>You must be a member of the MWO website and have MWO installed on your computer.  Your must be able to play MWO with at least minimal hardware/bandwidth requirements. Your software must be kept up-to-date with the latest patches as required for consistent participation with the unit.  MWO is a free-to-play online game available for download at <a target="_blank" href="http://mwomercs.com">mwomercs.com</a>.</p></li>
	<li><h3>Teamspeak</h3><p>This unit uses a voice chat software called Teamspeak (<a target="_blank" href="http://teamspeak.com/">teamspeak.com</a>) for in-game organization, direction, and just plain fun. If you have a problem with having your voice heard, do not join this unit.</p></li>
	<li><h3>Equipment</h3><p>You must maintain the minimal system requirements for multiplayer play in MechWarrior Online. In addition to the MWO system requirements, a microphone will be required for voice communications.</p></li>
	<li><h3>Registration</h3><p>Because of the necessity of team communication both online and offline, you must be registered with this website and our forum. Often these are our primary tools to inform our membership of important happenings and updates.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Section 3. Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>The Militia requires that all members adhere to the Code of Conduct (CoC) as posted on the MWO website (<a href="http://mwomercs.com/conduct">mwomercs.com/conduct</a>).</p>

<p>In addition to these guidelines, the following will apply:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Codex, in particular the sections outlined below, must be followed at all times.</li>
  <li>A violation of the CoC will likely result in demotion, suspension, or even expulsion from the unit. Violations of the CoC require a meeting, including that member's Corps Commander (if applicable) and the Command Staff, to decide the extent of damage to the unit and the fitting reprimand. The meeting may take place either via text chat, voice chat, or via a special forum on the members intranet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 4. Unit Structure</h2>

<ul>
	<li><h3>Chain of Command</h3>
  <p>The Chain of Command will consist of 10 defined unit positions, or ranks, as described below:</p>

	<h3>Divisions of the Militia</h3>
	<p>The unit consists of a command lance and 5 divisions referred to as "Corps". These divisions of the Militia are as follows:</p>
	<ul>
  	<li>ALPHA Corps,</li>
  	<li>BRAVO Corps,</li>
  	<li>CHARLIE Corps,</li>
  	<li>DELTA Corps, and</li>
  	<li>ECHO Corps.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Each Corps is run somewhat INDEPENDENTLY of the others and is expected to be able to hold its own as an individual fighting force. Each is also assigned a "code name", i.e. an unofficial name that reflects that Corps' fighting spirit. Members of each Corps are encouraged to get to know one another, as they will be expected perform together.</p>

	<p>The bulk of each Corps is divided into 2 lances: a "heavy" assault lance and a "light" assault lance. Typically, each lance within a Corps will perform a specific function in battle. These lances are refered to by the Corps designator and a number, for example "BRAVO 1" refers to the BRAVO heavy lance, and "BRAVO 2" refers to the BRAVO light lance. This makes quick tactical decisions in battle possible for those in command.</p>

  5. &nbsp;COMMAND RESPONSIBILITY</font><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>

  <br>

  Rank = Responsibility</font><br>

  <br>

  Rank within the Militia is not just defined 

  by a title. With each rank comes a new 

  level of responsibility. This is especially 

  true in regard to command positions, i.e. 

  Lance Command, Corps Command, and Executive 

  Command. Following is a description of 

  each level of responsibility:<br>

  <br>

  <font color="#FFFFFF">General Ranks<br>

  Sergeant Major (05-SGM), Sergeant (04-SGT), 

  Corporal (03-CPL),<br>

  Private First Class (02-PFC), Private 

  (01-PVT)</font></font></p>

</div>

<blockquote> 

<div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"> 

  <font color="#FFFFFF">Description</font>: 

  These members are the "big stick" 

  that the Militia carries into battle. 

  They are the base fighting strength of 

  our unit. The general ranks must learn 

  to work well together and under the direction 

  of several different levels of command. 

  Their immediate battle commander is their 

  Lance Commander, either Light (LLC) or 

  Heavy (HLC).</font>

    General ranks do not hold command responsibility 

    with respect to unit structure. When 

    split into smaller fighting units on 

    the field, the highest ranking member 

    assumes command responsibility. If ranks 

    are the same, the member with the highest 

    seniority assumes command. The exception 

    to this is the Sergeant Major (SGM), 

    which, in addition to being a big gun, 

    must train for assumption of duties 

    as an LLC. These ranks are a NORMAL 

    ACTIVITY role in the unit. Members that 

    fall below normal activity will be removed 

    as determined by their CC.</font></div>

  Light Lance Commanders have assembled 

  under them the lightest and fastest Mechs 

  of the unit. The Light Lance of each Corps 

  handles missions that utilize that speed, 

  such as recon missions, fire support for 

  the heavier assault mechs, short-range 

  support for the heavier long-range mechs, 

  or even suprise attacks on opposing Mechs 

  that have wandered away from the main 

  battle group. It is essential that Light 

  Lance members learn to work together and 

  concentrate their efforts, and it is the 

  Light Lance Commander's responsibility 

  to make sure that they do just that. Due 

  to the ranks involved in the Light Lance 

  (PVT and PFC), the Light Lance Commander 

  also assumes the pilot training duties 

  that are essential to the success of the 

  unit. <br>

  for PILOT TRAINING for and EXECUTION of 

  basic to advanced maneuvers in light mechs. 

  Light lance is a supporting role, meaning 

  they primarily act as either an escort 

  for heavy mechs or as long-range suppression. 

  The combination of a heavy and a light 

  winging in a tight formation is a hard 

  nut to crack. Use of the light lance as 

  long range suppression is needed as the 

  lighter mechs can close those distances 

  quickly and tie up an opponent until the 

  heavies come into range. An LLC is also 

  expected to train for the HLC position, 

  which may occasionally involve assumption 

  of HLC duties for evaluation purposes 

  as determined by the CC. This is a HIGH 

  ACTIVITY role in the unit.<br>

    to the higher payload of the larger 

    Mechs, their roles in battle are typically 

    full assault or long-range support. 

    As the Heavy Lance pilots are the tactical

    Lance, assuming he performs well in 

    both command tasks. Knowledge of Light 

    Lance maneuvers and abilities is essential 

    to his duties as HLC. The HLC will work 

    closely with the LLC to make sure he 

    is getting the support he requires for 

    success on the battlefield. An HLC is 

    also expected to train for the CC position,

  Corps Commanders as a whole are in essence 

  the backbone of the Militia. Each Corps 

  within the Militia is under direct command 

  of one individual. Each Corps Commander 

  must learn to use his two "fists", 

  the Heavy Lance and the Light Lance, to 

  make the most effective presence on the 

  battlefield. He works very closely with 

  his Lance Commanders and is ultimately 

  responsible for their success. Due to 

  this extremely high level of responsibility, 

  all issues within his Corps regarding 

  assignment of rank and delegation of duties 

  are made by him. A Corps Commander must 

  always maintain a high level of alertness 

  in battle and be fully aware of his Corps' 

  performance on the field. He must be quick 

  to change tactics "on the fly", 

  and he must be sure that his Lances understand 

  those tactics and can adapt to them quickly. 

  A Corps' success will most likely hinge 

  on the abilities of its Commander, so 

  only the most organized, most adaptive, 

  most active, and most skilled members 

  of the Militia are considered for this 

  position. <br>

  <br>

  In addition to battle command, a Corps 

  Commander handles any and all administration 

  of his Corps, including the signing of 

  new members, roster changes, practice 

  schedules, and meetings. A Corps Commander 

  must also be capable of cutting members 

  that do not measure up to the standards

  his Corps conforms to the standards set 

  for the unit, so that each Corps knows 

  what to expect from the others. He must 

  also make sure that his officers understand 

  their duties and perform them well. His 

  tactical decisions are of the highest 

  regard in his Corps, although he may leave 

  some room for experimentation on the part 

  of his officers. He is also responsible 

  for inter-Corps correspondance with other 

  CC's for strategical input, training scrimages, 

  or transferance of members for personal, 

  promotional, or tactical reasons. He should 

  be ready to lose an officer (due to promotion, 

  demotion, or expulsion) at any time, and 

  should make sure that the appropriate 

  members have been trained to assume those 

  positions. This is a VERY HIGH ACTIVITY

  Mercenaries<br>

  </font></font><br>

  The Militia is a MERCENARY unit, meaning 

  special rules regarding contracts will 

  apply. Make sure these special rules are 

  understood. If necessary, contact a Rules 

  Admin to get a ruling on any issues that 

  may arise.<br>

  <br>

  As mercenaries, we are capable of taking 

  contracts against other units on either 

  a multi-battle or a per-battle basis. 

  Multi-battle contracts are can be browsed 

  or taken by Command Staff members under 

  the 'Contracts' area of the MW4VL site. 

  In multi-battle contracts, DO NOT DISCLOSE 

  the employer to the target unit, nor should 

  you tell the target that the battle is 

  for fulfillment of the contract. This 

  is in the MW4VL rules and breaks the trust 

  assumed under the contract. In a per-battle 

  contract, at least one member of the employing 

  unit must participate in the battle with 

  you. This means that any members of the 

  Militia may participate in a battle as 

  "filler", as long as a fee percentage 

  has been declared before the battle. If 

  this does not make sense to you, READ 

  THE RULES.<br>

  <br>

  The MW4VL is a "merc friendly" 

  league, and we are lucky to be in the 

  position that we are. Take advantage of 

  that position as much as possible.<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><br>

  Validation<br>

  </font></font><br>

  Before league participation is allowed, 

  new members must be validated by either 

  the Corps Commander of the recruiting 

  Corps, by that Commander's appointed training 

  officer, or by the Command Staff. The 

  validation process is a training/testing 

  process that is used to verify one's ability 

  to attack, defend, or operate in a team 

  environment effectively. Ideally, validation 

  should occur within the MW4 environment. 

  However, the MW3 environment can be substituted 

  if neccessary. If the validation occurs 

  under MW3, the M3LX cheat detection module 

  is REQUIRED by all individuals involved. 

  Unfortunately, our experience has shown 

  that possible cheats have appeared under 

  testing conditions.<br>

  Training mods are meant to determine one's 

  knowledge of various weapons systems and 

  how to use them effectively. <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF">The 

  MW4VL league is Omni-mod, i.e. all weapons 

  systems are allowed, but basic knowledge 

  of each type of system, how it is used, 

  and how it is avoided are the key elements 

  in this process. Team functionality is 

  also an important aspect of the validation 


  process.<br>

  <br>

  </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font>The 

  following basic criteria can be used for 

  most player validations:<br>

  1. Energy weapons only, 1 vs 1 combat;<br>

  2. Projectile weapons only, 1 vs 1 combat;<br>

  3. Missile weapons only, 1 vs 1 combat;<br>

  4. Omni-mod (all weapons), team-based 

  combat.<br>

  <br>

  Validating officers should not clear a 

  member for league play until it is certain 

  that the validatee understands each of 

  these weapons systems and can function 

  effectively in team combat situations.<br>

  </font></font><br>

  Every member of this unit is expected 

  to uphold a reasonable level of activity. 

  A unit with inactive members is a dead 

  unit, as we should all be painfully aware. 

  The minimal activity requirements are 

  as per section 2 above.<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><br>

  </font></font><br>

  Every member of this unit</font></font></font></font> 

  is expected to maintain a reasonable level 

  of contact with the leaders of the unit. 

  Ranks below Corps Commander are expected 

  to keep their CC's informed of changes 

  in activity. Corps Commanders are expected 

  to keep the CO and XO informed of Corps 

  performance, activity, and roster changes. 

  Communication is the key to a successful 

  team. <br>

  </font></font><br>

  Always put your best foot forward in dealings 

  with players both internal and external 

  to the unit. We wish to present ourselves 

  as serious, competent players, that enjoy 

  working together as a team. Keeping morale 

  up is one thing, but acting the fool is 

  another...be aware of the difference.<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><br>

  A unit is often only as good as the image 

  it presents. Therefore, in formal situations 

  (i.e. league battles, dealings with members 

  from other units, or dealings with league 

  administration), please address officers 

  and officials with the formal "Sir". 

  </font></font></font></font></font></font>This 

  incudes members of other units as well 

  as our own.<br>

  <br>

  This will become particularly involved 

  as we progress into more role-play (RP) 

  situations and/or leagues.<br>

  <br>

  Dealings within the unit are considered 

  "at ease", and should not require 

  formalities. All members of this unit 

  work hard and deserve respect, or they 

  would not be here. "At ease", 

  however, does not waive awareness of rank. 

  If common courtesies must be waived for 

  you to get your point across to a superior 

  ranking officer, a simple request to speak 

  "freely and privately" should 

  be made. An officer should honor such 

  requests, and should be available to open 

  discussions of this nature.<br>

  </font></font> <br>


  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font color="#FFFFFF">Promotion 

  or Demotion<br>

  </font></font><br>

  Promotion within the Militia is based 

  on a number of factors, which include 

  leadership ability, skill level, dedication, 

  attitude, activity, and availability. 

  Each Corps Commander should be aware of 

  each of these factors when considering 

  promotion of one of his Corps members. 

  The squeaky wheel does NOT get the grease 

  here. Promotion within the Command ranks 

  is decided by the Executive Command and 

  follows the same guidelines as any other 

  member. <br>

  <br>

  Demotions are an unfortunate occurance 

  that are required to continue efficient 

  operation, but should only be used as 

  a last resort. If any member of this Militia 

  is demoted for any reason, an explanation 

  is required for the Command Staff. Demotions 

  within the Command ranks again will be 

  decided by the Executive Command.<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><br>

  <br>

  Promotion or demotion of officers (Lieutenant 

  and up) require consultation and APPROVAL 

  of a member of the Executive Command. 

  These are key positions that affect the 

  unit as a whole, and therefore must be 

  handled with care.<br>

  </font></font> <br>

  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#AAB2AF"><font color="#FFFFFF">Explusion 

  <br>

  </font></font><br>

  Expulsion is the forced removal of a member 

  from the unit. Every member of this team 

  has been brought on board because we KNOW 

  they will perform. We do not just add 

  people to the roster and see how they 

  work out. Therefore, our members are NOT 

  removed without due process. In order 

  for a Corps Commander to remove a member 

  from the roster, the following must be 

  performed:</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p>

    is a warning of responsibilities unfulfilled.

    2. <font color="#FFFFFF">Correspondance.</font> 

    A member that is in danger of being 

    removed from the roster must first be 

    given proper notice of his violation(s) 

    and given a chance to explain or resign. 

    This notice should be made via email 

    and carbon copies of the notice should 

    be sent to the Executive Command. A 

    resonable amount of time (2 to 3 days) 

    should be given for a reply.<br>

    <br>

    3. <font color="#FFFFFF">If the offending 

    member is an officer, approval.</font> 

    This officer has been given a rank of 

    responsibility in this unit and reasoning 

    for removal must be approved by the 

    Executive Command.<br>

    Only after the above tasks have been

of Power<br>

</font></font><br>

Abusing the power of command, namely the Corps Commander position, will be dealt with on a case by case basis. Abuse constitutes over-manipulation of the roster for personal issues wth certain Corps members, preventing the advancement of certain deserving individuals due to unfounded personality issues, lack of communication with the Executive Command when making drastic changes to Corps rosters, or manipulation of the Codex in any form without approval of the Executive Command.</p>
<p>This should not be confused with the finality of decisions made by the Executive Command.</p>
<p>Continual abuse of command will likely result in a Corps review or demotion to a non-officer position. </p>
